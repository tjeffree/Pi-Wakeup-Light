# Pi-Wakeup-Light
A wakeup light powered by a Raspberry Pi and white LED strip

---

## Prerequisites
This project is based off of the tutorial [here](http://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/) by [dordnung](https://github.com/dordnung). Following that guide will help a lot towards getting this going!

For the wakeup light I am using a white LED strip - this simplifies the tutorial above to just a single MOSFET circuit.

## Usage

`python ./wakeup.py 06:30`
